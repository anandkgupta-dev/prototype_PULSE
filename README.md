# PULSE: Patient Update & Log Structuring Engine

### Subtitle: NLP-based Clinical Handover Information Extraction and Event Structuring System

---

## 1. Project Title & Overview

**PULSE** (*Patient Update & Log Structuring Engine*) is a full-stack, research-oriented natural language processing (NLP) system designed to extract clinical entities, temporal expressions, and patient events from unstructured nursing shift handover narratives, structuring them into a standardized, multi-category clinical handover dashboard.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### Clinical Scope & Research Safety Statement
> **"PULSE is an AI-assisted clinical information-organization prototype. It does not diagnose, prescribe treatment, or replace professional clinical judgment."**
> This prototype is strictly built for research and clinical information organization. It does not provide automated medical advice, diagnostic predictions, or therapeutic decisions.

## 2. Research Problem & Objective

### Clinical Handover Problem
Nursing shift handover is a pivotal communication event in acute and subacute hospital wards. Outgoing nurses transfer critical patient state updates, vital sign trends, pending diagnostic procedures, and upcoming care tasks to incoming staff. However, free-text or verbal nursing handovers suffer from:
- **High information entropy:** Unstructured, conversational, and fragmented prose.
- **Ambiguous clinical shorthand:** Extensive ward-specific abbreviations (e.g., *BP, GCS, BGL, IV, PRN, QID, HPN, AF, COPD*).
- **Missing or disconnected temporal anchors:** Ambiguities regarding when investigations took place or when medication changes occurred.
- **Omitted pending duties:** Loss of continuity regarding scheduled scans, pending doctor reviews, or repeat blood tests.

### Research Objective
To develop an automated computational pipeline that ingests unstructured nursing handover text, normalizes formatting while rigorously preserving clinical tokens (`@`, `+`, `_`, measurements, dosages, and acronyms), extracts entities and events, and synthesizes a **standardized 9-category structured clinical handover**.

## 4. System Architecture & NLP Pipeline

PULSE implements an 8-stage modular processing pipeline:

```
[ UNSTRUCTURED NURSING HANDOVER TEXT ]
                  ↓
          [ PREPROCESSING ]
  - Clean formatting, preserve clinical meaning
  - Preserves @, +, _, measurements, dosages, units
  - Normalizes whitespace & Unicode quotes
                  ↓
  [ CLINICAL INFORMATION & ENTITY EXTRACTION ]
  - Patient Demographics (Bed, Name, Age, Gender, Doctor)
  - Medical Conditions & Diagnoses
  - Reported Symptoms
  - Medications, Dosages, Routes & Frequencies
  - Diagnostic Investigations & Procedures
  - Clinical Measurements & Vital Signs
  - Clinical Abbreviations Catalog
                  ↓
          [ EVENT EXTRACTION ]
  - Admissions, Med administrations, Scans scheduled/completed
  - State observations & multidisciplinary referrals
                  ↓
        [ TEMPORAL EXTRACTION ]
  - Clock times, shifts, relative temporal anchors
  - Event-to-time association
                  ↓
    [ PENDING TASKS & FOLLOW-UP ]
  - Prioritized outstanding nursing/medical duties
  - Scheduled reviews and repeat diagnostic orders
                  ↓
    [ 9-CATEGORY STRUCTURED HANDOVER ]
  - Synthesized standardized clinical output
                  ↓
    [ REACT VISUAL DASHBOARD ]
  - Interactive source-text highlighting
  - Preprocessing comparison & evidence citations
```

## 5. Standardized 9-Category Handover Schema

PULSE organizes clinical narratives into the following 9 standard categories:

1. **Patient Information:** Patient identifier, bed/room, age, gender, and attending consultant.
2. **Current Condition:** Admission presentation reason, active symptoms, and acute vital sign status.
3. **Medical History:** Chronic conditions, past surgical history, and pre-existing comorbidities.
4. **Medications / Treatment:** Active medications, dosages, routes, frequencies, and nursing interventions.
5. **Investigations:** Diagnostic radiology, pathology, blood glucose logs, and bedside telemetry.
6. **Clinical Events:** Discrete clinical actions (admissions, completed scans, adjusted therapy).
7. **Temporal Information:** Explicit and relative temporal anchors tied to clinical actions.
8. **Pending Tasks:** Prioritized tasks awaiting execution during the shift (doctor reviews, rescheduled tests).
9. **Follow-up:** Long-term clinical reviews, repeat diagnostic tests, and specialist consultations.

## 11. Model Disclosure & Research Integrity

In accordance with academic standards:
- **Current Prototype:** Hybrid clinical information extraction pipeline (regex patterns, clinical dictionaries, and rule-based event extractors).
- **Planned Candidate Backbone:** `Bio_ClinicalBERT` (Alsentzer et al., 2019).
- **Model Status:** Candidate / planned for experimental fine-tuning evaluation.
- **Academic Transparency:** This prototype does not present synthetic or fabricated accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 scores. Quantitative evaluation will be conducted once the transformer model has completed experimental training against the reference annotation files.

---

## 12. Current Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations
- Current entity and event recognition utilizes a rule/dictionary-based hybrid pipeline; unseen colloquial phrasings may require rule expansion.
- Processing is optimized for single-patient handover paragraphs rather than multi-page clinical discharge summaries.

### Future Work
- **Bio_ClinicalBERT Fine-Tuning:** Train a token-classification NER head directly on the 101 annotated reference documents in `data/101informationextraction/`.
- **EHR Integration:** Implement FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) data export for seamless Electronic Health Record integration.
- **Audio Handover Transcription:** Add a Whisper-based speech-to-text front-end for verbal nursing handover transcription.
